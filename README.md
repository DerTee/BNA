# BNA
A minimal game framework inspired by XNA for the Beef programming language

## Third party dependencies
BNA depends on a handful of third party libraries. Windows 32 and 64 bit lib+dlls of these are included, if you want to compile for other platforms such as Linux or Mac you'll need to compile these yourself:

1. FNA3D - https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D
2. SDL2 - https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
3. SoLoud (compiled with WITH_SDL2) - https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud

## Usage
See Wiki for getting started guide + documentation ([Getting Started](https://github.com/KillaMaaki/BNA/wiki/Getting-Started))
